# Magic as a Service™

Magic as a Service™ is a creative engineering company. Our mission is to reinvent digital products and services, providing knowledge by blending creativity, technology and culture into something unseen, whether commercial or open source.

We are currently busy working on a tokenized design system, a bunch of plugins for Vue, scaffolding a foundry and relaunching our platform for open source fonts. Feel free to follow us, while we try to carve out a space for ourselves in the digital world.
